# Basketball SportVU Visualizations in Dash
___
## Overview

SportVU publicly released movement data for NBA players from the 2015-2016 season. We have taken this data--that was further aggregated and processed by Neil Seward--and created a trio of visualizations, accessible through Plotly's Dash framework. The three visualizaton tabs appear roughly as follows when the application is started: 

Tab 1:

## How to Install

This application is available to use with (very) limited resources at http://mmechtly.pythonanywhere.com. It will continue to be viewable until my free account expires.

Alternatively, clone the repo, then create a virtual env or conda environment using the `requirements.txt` file. Launch locally or wherever else desired

## How to Use

Cycle between the various 3 tabs by clicking on the tab names. On each tab, selections exists that can further filter what data to look at.
